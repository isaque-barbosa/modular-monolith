## Modular Monolith

## Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to gain further practice with this architecture while exploring a more straightforward approach compared to those I have encountered online. I aim to create modules that are as simple and basic as possible, relying solely on the API to expose endpoints and ensuring that communication between modules remains decoupled.
